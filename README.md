### 🧠 What I Bring to the Table

I speak the languages of both machines and humans:

*   **🤖 The Physical World:** Automation, Robotics, Embedded Systems (C/C++), PLCs, Electrical Design.
*   **🌐 The Digital World:** Full-Stack Web Development (JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python), APIs, Databases.
*   **🔗 The Connective Tissue:** IoT Architecture, Data Pipelines, System Integration, and Process Optimization.

My engineering mindset isn't just about writing code—it's about architecting **efficient, reliable, and elegant systems** that solve real-world problems.
